                                <p>Squirrels are members of the family Sciuridae, a family that includes
                                        small or medium-size rodents. The squirrel family includes tree squirrels,
                                        ground
                                        squirrels, chipmunks, marmots (including groundhogs), flying squirrels, and
                                        prairie dogs
                                        amongst other rodents. Squirrels are indigenous to the Americas, Eurasia, and
                                        Africa,
                                        and were introduced by humans to Australia.The earliest known fossilized
                                        squirrels date
                                        from the Eocene epoch, and among other living rodent families, the squirrels are
                                        most
                                        closely related to the mountain beaver and to the dormice.</p>

                                <p>The word "squirrel", first attested in 1327, comes from the Anglo-Norman esquirel
                                        which is from the Old French escurel, the reflex of a Latin word sciurus, which
                                        was taken from the Ancient Greek word σκίουρος (from σκία-ουρος), skiouros,
                                        "shadow-tailed", referring to the long bushy tail which many of its members
                                        have.
                                        The native Old English word for the squirrel, ācweorna, survived only into
                                        Middle English (as aquerne) before being replaced.The Old English word is of
                                        Common Germanic origin, cognates of which are still used in other Germanic
                                        languages, including the German Eichhörnchen (diminutive of Eichhorn, which is
                                        not as frequently used), the Norwegian ikorn/ekorn, the Dutch eekhoorn, the
                                        Swedish ekorre and the Danish egern. A group of squirrels is called a "dray"or a
                                        "scurry".</p>

                                        <h3>Feeding</h3>
                                        <p>Because squirrels cannot digest cellulose, they must rely on foods rich in
                                                protein, carbohydrates, and fats. In temperate regions, early spring is
                                                the hardest time of year for squirrels because the nuts they buried are
                                                beginning to sprout (and thus are no longer available to eat), while
                                                many of the usual food sources have not yet become available. During
                                                these times, squirrels rely heavily on the buds of trees. Squirrels,
                                                being primarily herbivores, eat a wide variety of plants, as well as
                                                nuts, seeds, conifer cones, fruits, fungi, and green vegetation. Some
                                                squirrels, however, also consume meat, especially when faced with
                                                hunger.Squirrels have been known to eat small birds, young
                                                snakes, and smaller rodents, as well as bird eggs and insects. Some
                                                tropical squirrel species have shifted almost entirely to a diet of
                                                insects.</p>

                                        <p>Squirrels, like pigeons and other fauna, are synanthropes, in that they
                                                benefit and thrive from their interaction in human environments. This
                                                gradual process of successful interaction is called synurbanization,
                                                wherein squirrels lose their inherent fear of humans in an urban
                                                environment.[26] When squirrels were almost completely eradicated during
                                                the Industrial Revolution in New York, they were later re-introduced to
                                                "entertain and remind" humans of nature. The squirrel blended into the
                                                urban environment so efficiently that when synanthropic behavior stops
                                                (i.e. people do not leave trash outside during particularly cold
                                                winters), they can become aggressive in their search for food. <span

                                                        preying on atypical animals, such as an incident in 2005 where a
                                                        pack of
                                                        black squirrels killed and ate a large stray dog in Lazo,
                                                        Russia. As
                                                        well, squirrel attacks on humans are exceedingly rare, but do
                                                        occur.</p>

                                                <p>Whitaker examined the stomachs of 139 thirteen-lined ground squirrels
                                                        and found bird flesh in four of the specimens and the remains of

                                                        white-tailed antelope squirrels, found at least 10% of his 609

                                <p class="s">Squirrels mate either once or twice a year and, following a
                                        gestation
                                        period of three
                                        to
                                        six weeks, give birth to a number of offspring that varies by species. The young
                                        are
                                        altricial, being born naked, toothless, and blind. In most species of squirrel,
                                        the
                                        female alone looks after the young, which are weaned at six to ten weeks and
                                        become
                                        sexually mature by the end of their first year. In general, the ground-dwelling
                                        squirrel
                                        species are social, often living in well-developed colonies, while the
                                        tree-dwelling
                                        species are more solitary.</p>
                                <p class="s">Ground squirrels and tree squirrels are usually either diurnal or
                                        crepuscular, while
                                        the flying squirrels tend to be nocturnal—except for lactating flying squirrels
                                        and
                                        their young, which have a period of diurnality during the summer.</p>
